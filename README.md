# Can I clone this Dribbble design?

This is the code from my attempt at creating [this Dribble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2980874-Slopes-Website) by [tubik](https://dribbble.com/Tubik) with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS.

## The video

You can [watch me code this in this video]().

## The background video

I can't redistribute the video file that I used, but you could get a free one to replace it on [Pexels Video](https://www.pexels.com/videos/), if you want to try your own version, or to improve what I created.
